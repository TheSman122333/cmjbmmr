				<h3>What is the Issue:</h3>
				<p>
					Black Maternal Mortality has been and still is a pressing issue in the United States today. 
				</p>
				<img src="/images/statpage1.png" alt={`statpage1`} class="float-img"/>
				<p>
					There are several black mothers who’ve undergone complications in their pregnancy (such as preeclampsia), but do not get the proper care they need. This is typically because of the discrimination they face when seeking healthcare for these issues (Chambers et. al) This can affect these mothers’ and infants’ health, and in some cases, lead to death- often solely due to their racial identity. Unfortunately, this is still a common occurrence in the United States, and we have not taken significant action to solve this issue.

			<img src="/images/pain.png" alt={`Symptoms arise.`} class="float-img" />
			<p><i>These symptoms are typically indicative of preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition that can develop during pregnancy. This condition can affect other organs in your body such as the liver or the kidneys, which can put the mother and the fetus at risk. It is important that mothers with this condition can get treatment as soon as possible in order to avoid possible complications that could put their life at risk.

				<p>Aaliyah decides to call the doctor again, hoping the doctor would take her more seriously when she talks about the recurrence and worsening of the symptoms. </p>
				<p>Doctor: ”Hello, what seems to be the concern?”</p>
				<p>Aaliyah: ”Hi, my symptoms got worse. I’ve developed blurry vision, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.”</p>
				<p>Doctor: “Oh don’t worry, you just need to rest and take it easy. Your body is probably overreacting to all of the changes you are experiencing.”</p>
				<img src="/images/statpagewhite.png" alt={`Post-White doctor`} class="float-img" />
				<p>Unfortunately, just like Aaliyah, many Black women are often discriminated against during their healthcare visits, even more so than white women. There has been a larger amount of reports from Black women ages 18-64 of getting discriminated against during visits to a healthcare provider than White women, with that of Black women being 6% higher. (“Women's Experiences with Provider Communication and Interactions in Health Care Settings: Findings from the 2022 KFF Women's Health Survey”). </p>
				<p style="margin-top: 11vh;">One potential consequence is the death of the mother, especially with severe complications or disorders.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Another possible outcome is stillbirth, where the baby dies in the mother's womb.</p>
				<p>Black women in America are over twice as likely to have a stillbirth when compared to white women, and this is often because physicians often dismiss the concerns of Black women, who often have complications that could lead to severe consequences with the pregnancy and the baby eventually dying as a result (Eldeib and Hager). </p>

			<h2>Race Wage Gap problems</h2>
			<p>When Jin and Ana research, this is what they find:</p>
			<img src="/images/racepractice.png" alt={`Statpage 8`} class="float-img" />
			<p>
				1. The following section will explore the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all women and all men.
				Let’s look at the men as an example: 
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 1: Identify the median salary of all men: 1,202
				Step 2: Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Asian: |(Asian Median Salary )- (Median Salary for Men)| = |(1,635)-(1,202)| = 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Hispanic: |(Hispanic Median Salary)-(Median Salary for Men)| = |(915)-(1,202)| = 287
				<br>
				<br>
				Black: |( Black Median Salary) - (Median Salary for Men )| =|(970)-(1,202)|= 232
				<br>
				<br>
				White: | (White Median Salary)-(Median Salary for All Women)| = |(1,352)-(1,202)| = 150
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 3: Sort these 4 differences from least to most: 150, 232,  287, 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 4: Find the median of these differences, this will be your MAD:
				<br>
				<br>
				MAD =  (232+287)/2 = 259.5 
			</p>
			<h18>
			Now, use this process to find the MAD for all women:

			Identify the median salary of all women, and answer below: 
			<br>
			<br>
			Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1
			<br>
			<br>
			Asian: |(Asian Median Salary )- (Median Salary for Women)| = 
			<br>
			<br>
			Hispanic: |(Hispanic Median Salary)-(Median Salary for Women)| = 
			<br>
			<br>
			Black: |( Black Median Salary) - (Median Salary for All Women)|  =
			<br>
			<br>
			White: | (White Median Salary)-(Median Salary for All Women)|  =
			<br>
			<br>
			Sort these 4 differences from smallest to biggest:
			<br>
			<br>
			Find the median of these differences, this will be your MAD:

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Though Jin’s and Ana’s experiences were just a story, the wage gap issue is a problem that affects EVERYBODY. While Jin and Ana eventually received equal salary, it was only because of their persistence and willingness to bring social change. Here are ways YOU can help raise awareness about wage gap in your community:</p>
			<li>
				Share this website to others in your community 
			</li>
			<li>
				Encourage students to research wage inequality further.
			</li>
			<li>
				Have students find their own examples of wage inequality and present their findings.
			</li>
			<li>
				Challenge students to think critically about the causes and effects of wage inequality.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inspire students to advocate for fair pay and equal opportunities for all
