				<h3>What is the Issue:</h3>
				<p>
					Black Maternal Mortality has been and still is a pressing issue in the United States today. 
				</p>
				<img src="/images/statpage1.png" alt={`statpage1`} class="float-img"/>
				<p>
					There are several black mothers who’ve undergone complications in their pregnancy (such as preeclampsia), but do not get the proper care they need. This is typically because of the discrimination they face when seeking healthcare for these issues (Chambers et. al) This can affect these mothers’ and infants’ health, and in some cases, lead to death- often solely due to their racial identity. Unfortunately, this is still a common occurrence in the United States, and we have not taken significant action to solve this issue.

			<h2>Symptoms arise...</h2>
			<p>As days go by since her first visit to the doctor, Aaliyah starts to notice more complications arise. On top of frequent headaches, she develops blurry vision, abdominal pain, and worsening shortness of breath. </p>
			<img src="/images/pain.png" alt={`Symptoms arise.`} class="float-img" />
			<p><i>These symptoms are typically indicative of preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition that can develop during pregnancy. This condition can affect other organs in your body such as the liver or the kidneys, which can put the mother and the fetus at risk. It is important that mothers with this condition can get treatment as soon as possible in order to avoid possible complications that could put their life at risk. (“Preeclampsia: Toxemia, Causes, Symptoms & Risk Factors”).</i> </p>

			<h2>After visit with white doctor</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<img src="/images/whitedoc.png" alt={`Post-White doctor`} class="float-img" />
				<p>Aaliyah decides to call the doctor again, hoping the doctor would take her more seriously when she talks about the recurrence and worsening of the symptoms. </p>
				<p>Doctor: ”Hello, what seems to be the concern?”</p>
				<p>Aaliyah: ”Hi, my symptoms got worse. I’ve developed blurry vision, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.”</p>
				<p>Doctor: “Oh don’t worry, you just need to rest and take it easy. Your body is probably overreacting to all of the changes you are experiencing.”</p>
				<img src="/images/statpagewhite.png" alt={`Post-White doctor`} class="float-img" />
				<p>Unfortunately, just like Aaliyah, many Black women are often discriminated against during their healthcare visits, even more so than white women. There has been a larger amount of reports from Black women ages 18-64 of getting discriminated against during visits to a healthcare provider than White women, with that of Black women being 6% higher. (“Women's Experiences with Provider Communication and Interactions in Health Care Settings: Findings from the 2022 KFF Women's Health Survey”). </p>
				<p style="margin-top: 11vh;">One potential consequence is the death of the mother, especially with severe complications or disorders.</p>
				<p>Take a look at this image to the left, which shows us how many deaths there were per every 100,000 live births in 2022: </p>

					<Quiz questions={empty} 
						shortAnswerQuestions={[
							{
								question: "As demonstrated in the image above, is there a higher or lower chance of death for black moms and their infants as opposed to white moms? Why do you think this is?",
							}]}
						 />
				</div>
				<p>Another possible outcome is stillbirth, where the baby dies in the mother's womb.</p>
				<p>Black women in America are over twice as likely to have a stillbirth when compared to white women, and this is often because physicians often dismiss the concerns of Black women, who often have complications that could lead to severe consequences with the pregnancy and the baby eventually dying as a result (Eldeib and Hager). </p>

				<p>These are things that Aaliyah could have gone through because of the dismissal of her concerns.</p>
				<p>Now, see what would have happened if Aaliyah chose to go to a Black female doctor who takes her concerns seriously.</p>

				<p>Doctor: “Oh no! I am so sorry about your other doctor not taking you seriously! This sounds like a case of preeclampsia, we can test this with a simple blood test, urine test, and ultrasound to check the size of the baby.”</p>
